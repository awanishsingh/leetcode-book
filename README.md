# Introduction
### A GitBook for preparing programming interviews

Hint for a promising software engineer candidate:

[Do]
* Clearify the problem
* Write clean code
* Write test cases
* Debug with strategy

[Do not]
* Ask question later
* Write messy code
* Trap by edge cases
* Debug with guess

This needs practice.

This GitBook categorizes LeetCode problems with my implementation in Python.

Hope you enjoyed.
