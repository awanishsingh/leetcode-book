# Introduction
#### A GitBook for preparing programming interviews

In programming interviews, a promising software engineer candidate is expected to
* ask questions,
* write clean code which
	* is easy to read, 
	* is easy for extension,
* write bugs free code.

This needs practice.

This GitBook categorizes LeetCode problems with my implementation in Python.

Hope you enjoyed.
